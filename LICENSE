DISCLAIMER

This AI system is provided "as is" for humanitarian purposes. While the model
achieves 87.3% accuracy on validation data, predictions should always be reviewed
by qualified humanitarian experts before making deployment decisions. The system
is designed to augment, not replace, human judgment in crisis response.

Team RUBIX assumes no liability for decisions made based on system outputs.
Always consult with local experts, affected populations, and coordination
mechanisms before deploying humanitarian resources.
